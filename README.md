### What is CryptoKnights?

In one word, CryptoKnights is a game where **two medieval Knights bash each other with Swords**. The combat is performed real-time, but actions are made by playing Cards. It is thus a hybrid of **Real-Time Fighting Game** and **Digital Collectible Card Game**.

### Free to Play

**Anyone can download the game and start playing.** CryptoKnights will feel like a traditional free mobile game to a traditional gamer. However, as the player progresses through the game, it should be apparent that **opting into the blockchain ecosystem** will bring a much enhanced experience for them.

### Blockchain Integration

CryptoKnights allows in-game assets to be **transferred between the game and blockchains**. Those assets will be in the form of, in common understanding, **cryptocurrencies** (RUBY) and **NFTs** (Knights, Cards and more).

We aim to be a **multichain** game, meaning that the assets can exists on multiple blockchains, so as to interact with different cryptoassets on those blockchains.

### Play to Earn?

One can view CryptoKnights as a Play to Earn game (P2E), similar to other well-known blockchain games like Axie Infinity. However, with a combat system based on playing Cards, we like to see CryptoKnights as more of a Trading Card Game like Gods Unchained, where **value is created via trading Cards and items**.

Another core concept of CryptoKnights is that the **in-game assets are upgradable**. Knights can be leveled up, Cards can be combined, items can be enhanced. **The NFTs a player holds go up in value over time.** The cryptocurrency income is only a miniscule part of the game economy.

Therefore a better description of CryptoKnights should be **Play to Build**! Or, Play to Buidl.

### Sustainability

Since the main introduction of value is not from earning in-game currencies but from of building assets, **wealth can be created by the players in ways even the game developers could not have foreseen**, making the game economy more sustainable and not relying on new players keep joining the ecosystem.

### Advanced Financialization of Assets

CryptoKnights is heavily inspired by DeFi (Decentralized Finance), assets are designed to be **compatible with DeFi instruments**. We introduce new methods for NFT rental, scholarship, options, royalty split, AMMs (Automated Market Makers), and more.
