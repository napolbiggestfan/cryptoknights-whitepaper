# Gamemodes

### Ranked Game

Ranked Games are the "ladder". A notable design about CryptoKnights is that Knights are **matched based on their Levels and the power of their items,** instead of PvP ranking scores like in other games.

The winning Knight earns XP and can level up; the losing Knight loses XP and **can go down in level!**

If a player wins with an On-Chain Knight (NFT Knight), they will **earn RUBY as reward**. This is one of the "Play & Earn" aspect of the game.

### Normal Game

Normal Games use the same matchmaking system as Ranked Games but **players don't win or lose XP or RUBY**.

This gamemode is for fun or trying out new strategies.

### Story Mode

Player **fights bots** in different scenarios and earn rewards.

Can be seen as a tutorial, although some players may find Story Mode more enjoyable.

### Tournament

Tournaments are where **Clans compete with each other**.

A Player faces an opponent that might be from any clan participating in this tournament.

Clans and Players with the most scores will be on the Leaderboard and win prizes.

### Boss Fight

Members of a **Clan team up to fight a Boss**. The Boss has a lot of Health.

The Clan with the most scores will be on the Leaderboard and win prizes.

### Custom Match

Friends can set a Custom Match to fight each other.

A use case of this game mode is to set up matches for **eSports Tournaments**.
