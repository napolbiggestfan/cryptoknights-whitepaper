# Minting New Knights

### New Knights can be Minted

Since more and more players will join the game, the 10,000 Genesis Knights will **not be enough to meet the demand**. Therefore the players can mint new Knights as NFTs.

To mint a new Knight, the player must consume a Off-Chain Knight in their game account and pay the minting fees.

### Minting Fee is Determined by the IKO Floor Price

The fee for minting a new Knight will be **higher than the lowest winning price from the Initial Knight Offering**. We currently target it to be 30% percent higher. Therefore if the lowest winning price in the IKO is $50 USD, the minting fee for a new Knight will be $65 USD.

By this way, all participants in the IKO have a reasonable **advantage of getting in early**.

### Minting Fee goes up with Time

Since Knights do not have a fixed amount, the cost of minting a new Knight is designed to go up with time in order to **prevent the new Knights from diluting the value of older Knights**.

**Every time 100 new Knights are minted, the minting price goes up by $1 USD.**

By this way, if IKO Floor Price is $50 USD, the 100,000th Knight would cost $965 USD to mint.

We believe with this minting mechanism, **early adopters are incentivized** while new players can still get their own Knight without having to pay an absurd amount of money upfront.
